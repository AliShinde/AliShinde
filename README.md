## 👋 Summary

Master’s student in Computer Science at Clemson (backend + ML focus) with 2 years of professional experience at Infosys (Airbus client). I build Node/NestJS + Postgres services, SAP ABAP integrations, and research-y ML systems combining knowledge graphs with LLMs. Comfortable owning end-to-end: data, models, services, and dashboards.

* ⚙️ **Backend:** Node.js/Express, NestJS, REST/ODATA, Postgres/Prisma, Redis, Docker Compose
* 🧠 **AI/ML:** Summarization (FactorSum/BART), BioBERT, knowledge graphs + GNN (PyG), ROUGE eval, RAG
* 📊 **Data Viz:** Power BI (DAX, model tuning), matplotlib & pandas for analysis
* 🏗️ **SAP ABAP:** RAP unmanaged backend, ODATA services, CDS views, Adobe Forms

## 🔭 What I’m working on

* **Graph + LLM Summarization**: Heterogeneous KG + GNN encoder with BART decoder for legal/medical corpora; PyG + Hugging Face pipeline; export to lightweight local inference.
* **SMLC social media analytics**: Ingest + analyze library posts (Instagram/Twitter) for engagement insights; time-series features & clustering for content strategy.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1) GNN Legal Summarizer

Graph-enhanced summarization combining heterogeneous knowledge graphs with FactorSum/BART. Includes preprocessing with BERT tokenization and ROUGE evaluation.

* Repo: [https://github.com/AliShinde/GNN\_Legal\_Summarizer](https://github.com/AliShinde/GNN_Legal_Summarizer)
* Stack: PyTorch Geometric, Hugging Face, Python, ROUGE
* Highlights: Avg ROUGE ≈ 52 on PubMed-like corpus (prototype), modular data pipeline, reproducible notebooks

### 2) Knowledge-Graph Hybrid Summarizer (CivilSum extension)

Extends CivilSum to medical/legal domains with KG construction and GNN training pipeline.

* Stack: PyG (HeteroData, GATConv), BioBERT/BART, Python
* Highlights: End-to-end pipeline (KG build → training → ROUGE eval), Colab-ready training script

### 3) Power BI Analytics Portfolio

KPI dashboards, slicers, dynamic measures (TREATAS/KEEPFILTERS), YTD, PQ, and RLS; performance tuning and model optimization.

* Stack: Power BI, DAX, SQL
* Highlights: Practical, business-facing visualizations with clean modeling and performance best practices

### 4) Node/NestJS + Postgres + Redis Boilerplate

Containerized microservice skeleton with Prisma, rate limiting, Cloudinary integration, and request tracing.

* Stack: NestJS, Prisma, Postgres, Redis, Docker Compose
* Highlights: Health checks, graceful shutdown, multi-tenant friendly patterns
