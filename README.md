## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m working on

* **GNN Text Summarizer**: Graph-to-Sequence summarization pipeline with PyTorch Geometric + BART, Legal-BERT embeddings, reproducible training & evaluation, +14% ROUGE improvement on domain corpora.
* **SMLC Social Media Analytics (Clemson Lab)**: NLP, sentiment analysis, and engagement clustering on 150+ library event posts; dashboards for improved research dissemination.
* **Deployed GNN Summarizer**: Integrated the Graph-to-Sequence model into a **Spring Boot backend**, exposed via **FastAPI microservices**, and built a **React.js frontend** in a containerized microservices architecture, enabling scalable, end-to-end inference and user interaction.
